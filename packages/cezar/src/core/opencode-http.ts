/**
 * The runner's door to a local `opencode serve`: one JSON request, and the SSE
 * subscription. Neither carries a client-side header or body timeout.
 *
 * Why not the global `fetch`. Node's `fetch` is undici, and undici applies a
 * `headersTimeout`/`bodyTimeout` default of 300_000 ms to every request. The
 * prompt POST is a long poll — opencode does not answer `POST
 * /session/:id/message` until the agent's turn is over, tools and all — so at
 * exactly 5:00 undici tore it down with `TypeError: fetch failed`, the runner
 * read that as the end of the turn, and the cockpit parked a run whose session
 * was still working (#897). Raising the limit means constructing an `undici`
 * Agent, i.e. a new runtime dependency of the published CLI for a request the
 * platform can already make; `node:http` has no such default and needs nothing.
 *
 * The SSE subscription goes through the same door on purpose: `bodyTimeout` is
 * an inactivity timer, so a quiet session would lose its event stream after the
 * same 300 s — and the turn boundary now depends on that stream.
