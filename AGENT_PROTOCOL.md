# AGENT_PROTOCOL.md — the cezar agent protocol

cezar runs coding-agent CLIs behind **one backend-agnostic seam** and renders
every backend through **one normalized event vocabulary**. This document is the
operational contract for that seam: what a runner must implement, what it must
emit, how the emissions are tested, and what a *new* runner (e.g. `pi`, PR #387)
has to satisfy to be a first-class backend rather than a second-class one.

It is the concise, load-bearing contract. The deep design record lives in
`.ai/analysis/cockpit-ui-redesign/agent-event-protocols.md` (§7 schema, §7.1 the
per-backend mapping tables) and the spec `.ai/specs/2026-07-14-cockpit-ui-redesign.md`
(§"Normalized agent-event protocol v2", §"Backend parity requirement"). The code
in `packages/cezar/src/core/` cites those two by section; this file cites the code. When the two
disagree, **the code wins** — the golden fixtures and the parity test are
executable, the prose is not.

The protocol has **two layers that ship together**:

- **v1 `AgentEvent`** — the original flat stream. Persisted in old NDJSON
  recordings and still consumed by `cezar run`'s console renderer. Never
  removed; old recordings must keep replaying forever.
- **v2 `UiEvent`** — the normalized, item-lifecycle protocol the redesigned
  cockpit renders. Emitted **alongside** v1, never replacing it. A mixed NDJSON
  file (v1 + v2 lines) is valid by design.

---

## 1. The runner seam (`packages/cezar/src/core/agent-runner.ts`)

Every backend is one class implementing `AgentRunner`, constructed through the
single factory `createRunner(backend)` in `packages/cezar/src/core/runner-factory.ts`. Nothing
outside `packages/cezar/src/core/` should ever `new` a concrete runner or branch on the backend
id — that is the whole point of the seam.

### Identity

```ts
const RUNNER_IDS = ['claude', 'codex', 'opencode', 'cursor', 'pi'] as const;  // the source of truth
type RunnerId     = (typeof RUNNER_IDS)[number];                             // user-selectable
type AgentBackend = RunnerId | 'claude-cli';                                 // + legacy id, still parses
```

`RUNNER_IDS` is the tuple every other enumeration derives from — the zod schemas
(config, run store, workflow steps, the API bodies), the server-install
"at least one agent CLI" gate, and the CLI-handoff registry. Re-listing the ids
by hand is how a runner silently goes missing from one seam (#387 review); use
`RUNNER_IDS` / `isRunnerId()` instead.

`claude-cli` is a **legacy** backend id kept so old `runs.json` records and
NDJSON transcripts still parse; `createRunner` maps it onto `claude`. Follow that
precedent — never repurpose or remove a shipped id.

### `AgentRunner`

```ts
interface AgentRunner {
  readonly backend: AgentBackend;
  run(spec: AgentRunSpec, onEvent?: (e: AgentEvent) => void): Promise<AgentRunResult>;
  startSession(spec: AgentRunSpec, onEvent?: (e: AgentEvent) => void, opts?: SessionOptions): AgentSession;
  interrupt(): Promise<void>;
}
```

- `run()` is a one-shot convenience; `startSession()` is the real contract.
- Each backend runs as a **persistent process** so multi-turn follow-ups,
  `waiting`, interrupt and resume all work: claude = stream-json over
  stdin/stdout; codex = `codex app-server` JSON-RPC 2.0 (JSONL) over
  stdin/stdout; opencode = `opencode serve` over HTTP + SSE; pi =
  `pi --mode rpc` over JSONL stdin/stdout.

### `AgentSession`

A live session over one spawned process, alive between turns:

```ts
interface AgentSession {
  result: Promise<AgentRunResult>;   // resolves when the process exits
  readonly pid?: number;             // root of the run's process tree (resource telemetry, #348)
  sendMessage(content: ContentBlock[]): boolean;  // false when closed
  end(): void;                       // graceful: end input, SIGTERM→SIGKILL watchdog
  interrupt(): void;                 // hard stop (cancel)
  readonly open: boolean;
}
```

A termination the runner itself caused is **not** an agent failure (#703).
`end()` arms a SIGTERM→SIGKILL watchdog for CLIs that ignore EOF, and
`interrupt()` signals outright; the agent CLIs install their own handlers and
exit `128 + signal`. A runner MUST therefore record that it sent the signal and
settle such an exit on the normal path — `isSignalTerminationExit(exitCode)`
(`packages/cezar/src/core/agent-runner.ts`) plus a `note` — instead of throwing. Throwing makes
a finished run settle as `failed` and a cancelled run settle as `failed` too.

That watchdog MUST gate its SIGKILL escalation on real termination, never on
`ChildProcess.killed` (#844). Node sets `killed` when a signal is *delivered*,
so the watchdog's own SIGTERM flips it while the CLI — which handles the
signal — keeps running, and the escalation written for exactly that case is
skipped. Use `trackChildExit(child)` (`packages/cezar/src/core/agent-runner.ts`),
which seeds from `exitCode`/`signalCode` and listens for `exit`.

`SessionOptions`:

- `autoEndAfterFirstTurn?` — single-turn behavior for non-interactive workflow
  steps; interactive sessions control `end()` themselves.
- `onUiEvent?: (e: UiEvent) => void` — the **v2 channel**. It receives the
  normalized `UiEvent` stream emitted alongside the v1 `AgentEvent`s passed to
  `onEvent`. A runner that omits `onUiEvent` support degrades to v1-only — but a
  first-class backend MUST wire it (see §7).

### `AgentRunSpec`

The input to a run. Backend-agnostic; each runner translates it to its transport.
Notable fields (full doc-comments in the source):

- `userPrompt` (required), `systemPrompt?`, `images?` (first-message content
  blocks — pasted screenshots), `cwd` (the run dir and the only writable root),
  `model?`, `timeoutMs?`, `env?` (merged over `process.env` — carries
  `CEZ_HANDOFF_FILE` / `CEZ_TODOS_FILE` / `CEZ_TASK_ID`).
- `allowedTools?` / `bashAllowlist?` / `additionalDirectories?` — tool access.
  **Caveat (#430):** the zero-config default (`DEFAULT_ALLOWED_TOOLS`) includes
  unrestricted `Bash`, and Codex/OpenCode do not honor `allowedTools` at all.
  Treat the default `auto` permission mode as full shell access, not a
  sandbox: Codex uses `danger-full-access` with `approvalPolicy: never`, and
  OpenCode auto-approves every permission. Configurable restrictive modes are
  specified by `2026-07-17-permission-modes` (#475).
- `sessionId?` / `resume?` — stable session id for interactive takeover and for
  `--resume` ("Continue" after a run ends).

**System prompt channel** — a backend without a dedicated system-prompt input
must deliver `spec.systemPrompt` as a leading block of the opening user message.
Use the shared helper so the mapping is uniform:

```ts
prependSystemPrompt(spec.systemPrompt, spec.userPrompt)
// claude:          --append-system-prompt   (native channel, do NOT prepend)
// codex / opencode: prepended here
```

`ContentBlock` mirrors the Anthropic wire format (`text` | `image` base64) so it
can be written to the claude CLI's stdin verbatim.

---

## 2. v1 `AgentEvent` — the flat stream

The original normalized stream. Still emitted by every runner, still persisted,
still rendered by `cezar run`. **Do not remove or rename a variant** — v1 event
`type` strings are part of the on-disk NDJSON format.

```ts
type AgentEvent =
  | { type: 'text'; text: string }
  | { type: 'tool-call'; id: string; tool: string; input: unknown }
  | { type: 'tool-result'; toolCallId: string; result: string; isError: boolean }
  | { type: 'image'; mediaType: string; data: string }        // base64; run manager re-emits a URL
  | { type: 'token-usage'; tokensUsed: number }
  | { type: 'cost'; usd: number }
  | { type: 'session'; sessionId: string }                    // backend's real session id, once known
  | { type: 'turn-end'; reason?: 'context-compaction' }       // optional, additive (#955)
  | { type: 'note'; message: string }
  | { type: 'done' }
  | { type: 'error'; message: string };
```

`turn-end.reason` is optional and additive (#955), in the same shape as `note.tone`
(#936): a runner emits the bare event unless it knows something the turn's text
cannot say, an old recording with no `reason` replays unchanged, and an
unrecognized value degrades to "no reason given". `context-compaction` means the
turn's last act was the backend compacting its OWN context window with no
assistant message or native ask after it — internal session maintenance, not the
user being handed the next action — so the run manager keeps the run working and
continues once on the same thread instead of parking it at `waiting`. Codex emits
it off a completed `contextCompaction` item on its own thread; a runner that has
no such signal simply never sets the field.

Every v1 event stays **derivable** from the v2 stream, so a consumer can migrate
one panel at a time. New work should read v2; v1 exists for the console renderer
and old recordings.

### Cezar-owned run metadata events

`provider-auth-required` is not emitted by a backend runner. The server derives it
from an authoritative v1/v2 authentication error, persists a provider id, opaque
incident id, and optional `stepId`, and the cockpit renders recovery guidance. It
does not change backend parity or expose the raw error.

---

## 3. v2 `UiEvent` — the normalized protocol (`packages/cezar/src/core/ui-events.ts`)

Pure vocabulary: no runtime imports, no runner coupling. Mirrored into the
api-client package at `packages/api-client/src/protocol/ui-events.ts`; the mirror is **checked**,
not trusted — `packages/cezar/src/server/api-types.test.ts` asserts type-exactness between the
two, so drift fails `npm run typecheck` (the gate) rather than the UI at runtime.

### Design rules baked in

1. **Item-lifecycle model** (Codex/ACP style): one stable `id` per item with
   `started → delta → updated → completed` phases. Two of the three backends are
   natively item-shaped; claude maps trivially.
2. **ACP vocabulary** wherever a choice is arbitrary (tool status/kind, plan
   entries, diff shape, stop reasons) — ecosystem alignment.
3. **Per-capability degradation, never per-backend** — see §6.

### The item model (one id-keyed stream for text, reasoning and tools)

```ts
type UiItem = UiMessageItem | UiReasoningItem | UiToolItem;
```

- `UiMessageItem` — `kind:'message'`, `role`, `text`, `phase?:'commentary'|'final'`.
- `UiReasoningItem` — `kind:'reasoning'`, `text` (extended thinking / reasoning summary).
- `UiToolItem` — `kind:'tool'`, `name` (backend tool name), `toolKind`, `title`
  (human line computed once — see §5), `status`, `input?`, `output?`, `error?`,
  `diffs?: FileDiff[]`, `locations?`, `exitCode?`, `parentItemId?`.

`parentItemId` nests subagent work under the tool item that spawned it (claude
`parent_tool_use_id`, opencode `subtask` parts, Codex collaboration receiver
thread ids).

### Enumerations

```ts
type ToolStatus = 'pending' | 'running' | 'completed' | 'failed' | 'declined';
type ToolKind   = 'read'|'edit'|'delete'|'move'|'search'|'execute'|'think'|'fetch'|'task'|'plan'|'other';
type StopReason = 'end_turn'|'max_tokens'|'refusal'|'cancelled'|'timeout'|'error';
type PlanStatus = 'pending' | 'in_progress' | 'completed';
```

Supporting shapes: `PlanEntry` (`content`, `status`, `priority?`, `activeForm?`),
`TokenUsage` (raw `input`/`output`/`cacheRead?`/`cacheWrite?`/`reasoning?`/`total`,
`contextWindow?` — **never pre-weighted**; cost weighting is a presentation
concern), `FileDiff` (`path`, `oldText: string|null` where `null` = newly
created, `newText?`, `unified?`), `ToolLocation`, and the reserved
`PermissionOption`/`PermissionOptionKind`.

### The events

```ts
type UiEvent =
  | UiSessionStartedEvent    // 'session.started'  — sessionId, backend, model?, cwd?, tools?
  | UiSessionEndedEvent      // 'session.ended'    — reason: StopReason (replaces v1 done / fatal error)
  | UiSessionErrorEvent      // 'session.error'    — message, fatal (v1 note + error unified)
  | UiTurnStartedEvent       // 'turn.started'     — turnId
  | UiTurnCompletedEvent     // 'turn.completed'   — turnId, stopReason, usage?, costUsd?
  | UiItemStartedEvent       // 'item.started'     — item (tools usually pending/running)
  | UiItemDeltaEvent         // 'item.delta'       — itemId, field:'text'|'reasoning'|'output', delta
  | UiItemUpdatedEvent       // 'item.updated'     — item (status flips, streamed snapshots)
  | UiItemCompletedEvent     // 'item.completed'   — item (final snapshot, safe to persist)
  | UiPlanUpdatedEvent       // 'plan.updated'     — entries: PlanEntry[] (FULL replacement, ACP semantics)
  | UiPermissionRequestedEvent  // 'permission.requested' — RESERVED (types only; wired when approvals become optional)
  | UiPermissionResolvedEvent   // 'permission.resolved'  — RESERVED
  | UiAskRequestedEvent      // 'ask.requested'    — requestId, questions[] (AskUser; the cockpit renders option chips)
  | UiUsageUpdatedEvent      // 'usage.updated'    — usage: TokenUsage, costUsd? (cumulative-for-session)
  | UiImageEvent;            // 'image'            — itemId?, mediaType, data (base64; manager re-emits URL)
```

**AskUser (`ask.requested`, #473, #565).** The portable path remains
backend-neutral: the agent asks a structured
multiple-choice question by ending a turn with a `CEZ:ASK <json>` control marker
(a sibling of `CEZ:DONE` / `CEZ:MONITORING`); the RunManager detects it on the
*assembled* turn text — uniform across claude, codex and opencode with no mapper
work — validates the payload (`packages/cezar/src/core/ask.ts`, modeled on Claude Code's
`AskUserQuestion`: 1–4 questions, 2–4 options each, `header` ≤12 chars), emits
`ask.requested` and parks the run `waiting`. The cockpit renders clickable option
chips; the user's pick (or a free-form reply) rides the normal reply seam
(`POST /api/runs/:id/messages`), and the card resolves client-side when that
message lands (no `ask.resolved` event). Codex additionally bridges its native
`item/tool/requestUserInput` server request onto the same event and routes the
next answer back as the documented JSON-RPC response. Malformed or unsupported
native requests receive an error response rather than hanging the turn. A
malformed marker degrades to plain text — the prose fallback is never made
worse.

Two bounded forgiveness layers sit **under** that schema, and neither loosens
it. `normalizeAskRequest` recovers presentation drift (unknown keys dropped, an
over-long `header`/`description` clipped) — never counts, never choices.
`closeUnbalancedJson` (#936) recovers the one syntax slip agents actually make:
a payload complete except for its closing brackets, because a hand-written
one-line blob dropped a trailing `}` or the output-token limit cut the stream.
It appends the missing closers and re-parses, but only when the payload ends on
a **completed** structural value (`}` or `]`), the scan ends outside a string,
and every closer matched its opener — a stream cut mid-string, after a `,`, or
after a `:` is still refused, and an already-balanced payload (a trailing comma,
say) has nothing to repair. The repaired text goes through the unchanged schema,
so a repair yielding fewer than 2 options still degrades to plain text. What a
repair *can* lose is whatever the cut already took: a stream severed exactly on
an option boundary yields a real card missing a trailing option, or missing a
trailing `multiSelect` — so a recovered card is never passed off as a clean
parse. `AskMarkerParseResult` carries `repaired`, and the run records a
danger-toned recovery note asking the user to check the options, and how many
they may pick, against what was asked; the raw marker is stripped from the
transcript along with the card it produced. A native
`AskUserQuestion`
control-protocol bridge for claude (the `control_request can_use_tool` path) is a
possible future enhancement; the marker is the portable baseline.

`item.completed` carries **snapshots**, not deltas — safe to persist. `item.delta`
carries **appends** to one field of a live item and must not be persisted as a
standalone truth.

---

## 4. Per-backend mapping (summary)

Each backend has a mapper (`packages/cezar/src/core/<backend>-ui-mapper.ts`) turning its wire
transport into `UiEvent`s. The authoritative table is
`agent-event-protocols.md` §7.1; the load-bearing rows:

| v2 event / field | claude (stream-json) | codex (app-server JSON-RPC) | opencode (serve HTTP+SSE) | cursor (stream-json print mode) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `session.started` | `system/init` (model, tools, cwd) | `thread/started` / `thread/start` result | v1 `POST /session` or v2 `POST /api/session` response | `system/init` (model, cwd) |
| `turn.started` | each stdin user message | `turn/started` | each prompt POST (`/session/:id/message` v1, `/api/session/:id/prompt` v2) | no stdin turn boundary in print mode — starts `turn_1` with the session |
| `turn.completed` + `stopReason` | `result` subtype (`success→end_turn`, `error_max_turns→max_tokens`, `error_during_execution→error`) | `turn/completed→end_turn`, `turn/failed→error`, interrupt→`cancelled` | `session.idle→end_turn` (or `error` if a `session.error` preceded) | `result` (`is_error→error`, `subtype=error_max_turns→max_tokens`, else `end_turn`) |
| message item | `assistant` `text` blocks (deltas via `--include-partial-messages`) | `agentMessage` items | text parts | `assistant` `text` content blocks |
| reasoning item | `thinking` blocks | `reasoning` items (+ `textDelta`) | `reasoning` parts | *(none — docs: `thinking` events are suppressed in print mode)* |
| tool item | `tool_use`→running, `tool_result`→completed/failed, `permission_denials`→`declined` | `commandExecution`→execute (+`exitCode`, `outputDelta`), `fileChange`→edit (`diffs`), `mcpToolCall`→other, `webSearch`→fetch, collaboration spawn→task | tool parts (state `pending/running/completed/error→failed`, `patch` parts→`diffs`) | `tool_call` started/completed (`readToolCall`/`writeToolCall`/`editToolCall`/`shellToolCall`, or the generic `tool_call.function` wrapper) |
| `item.delta` `output` (live terminal) | *(none — card fills on completion; per-capability degradation)* | `item/commandExecution/outputDelta` | running-state metadata | *(none)* |
| `plan.updated` | `TodoWrite` input | `todoList` / `plan` items | `todowrite` tool | `TodoWrite` via `tool_call.function` — **tool name/shape not confirmed against a live CLI transcript** (#807) |
| subagent nesting (`parentItemId`) | `parent_tool_use_id` | collaboration receiver thread id (review mode remains childless) | child-session parts under a `subtask` | *(none — print-mode wire has no parent attribution; the task-kind tool item is the matrix cell)* |
| `usage.updated` | `result.usage` + `total_cost_usd` | `thread/tokenUsage/updated` (no USD) | `message.updated` tokens/cost + `step-finish` | *(none — the documented terminal `result` frame carries no `usage`/`total_cost_usd` field)* |

**Mapper robustness contract.** Inputs come off the wire and may be `null`,
partial or malformed. A mapper **must never throw**: unparseable NDJSON lines are
skipped (`packages/cezar/src/core/ndjson.ts` + the mapper), unknown message/content types
produce **no events**, and malformed entries in a `plan.updated` payload are
filtered out (a non-array plan emits no plan event at all). Mapper state is
**explicit and immutable** — each mapper's map function takes `(frame, state)`
and returns `{ events, state }`, never mutating the passed-in state
(`mapClaudeMessage` / `mapCodexNotification` / `mapOpencodeEvent`, each paired
with a `create<Backend>UiState`; see the claude mapper's "state carries across
messages" tests).

---

## 5. The tool display model (`packages/cezar/src/core/tool-display.ts`)

`toolDisplay(name, input)` turns a backend tool name + raw input into
`{ toolKind, title, subtitle? }`, computed **once** in the protocol layer (never
in components) so the thread, activity groups and notifications all say the same
thing. It is a pure function over untrusted input and **must never throw**. Tool
names are matched case-insensitively, so claude's `Bash` and opencode's `bash`
share one row; unknown tools keep the backend's name as the title with a
heuristic subtitle. `mcp__server__tool` names collapse to `server.tool`.

---

## 6. Backend parity — the hard rule (`packages/cezar/src/core/ui-parity.test.ts`)

> Every capability in the parity matrix MUST be emitted by **every first-class
> backend**, so the GUI degrades **per-capability, never per-backend** — unless
> the backend's own wire format provably cannot carry that capability, in which
> case the exclusion is written down and cited (see below).

This is made executable: `ui-parity.test.ts` asserts each capability over each
backend's golden-fixture expected output. If a mapper change drops a capability —
or a new fixture set forgets one — a named row fails. The matrix:

- `plan.updated` with entries (TodoWrite / todoList / todowrite)
- tool status `running`, `completed`, `failed`
- reasoning items (thinking / reasoning items / reasoning parts)
- structured diffs (Edit input / fileChange.changes / patch parts)
- sub-agent task items (Task / review-mode span / subtask parts) — one item per
  sub-agent: codex's `enteredReviewMode`/`exitedReviewMode` pair folds into a
  single `task` item with a running→completed lifecycle, so a consumer counting
  task items counts agents, not frames (spec
  `.ai/specs/2026-07-20-grouped-subagent-display.md`, #474)
- `usage.updated` with raw token counts
- `turn.completed` with a `stopReason`
- sub-agent **nesting** via `parentItemId` — only where the wire attributes work
  to its parent (claude's `parent_tool_use_id`, opencode's child-session parts
  under a `subtask`); codex, cursor and pi have no parent attribution in their
  wire format, so their matrix cell is the task-kind tool items above instead

A new backend is not "done" until it produces every row its wire format is
capable of. **Documented exceptions are allowed** when a capability provably
cannot be produced from the backend's own wire format — never for "not
implemented yet". An exception must: (1) cite the upstream source proving the
capability is absent (a vendor doc quote, or an honest "no live CLI available to
verify" when that citation cannot be obtained), (2) exclude only that backend
from that one row via `ui-parity.test.ts`'s `CAPABILITIES` table `except` list,
and (3) still assert every row the backend's wire format can produce. Cursor is
the first backend to use this: its documented print-mode `result` frame carries
no `usage`, and `thinking` events are documented as suppressed in print mode —
both cited inline next to the exclusion in the test.

## 7. The golden-fixture testing contract

Each backend has, under `packages/cezar/src/core/__fixtures__/<backend>/`:

- `<name>.ndjson` — a **wire-faithful** transcript of the backend's real output
  (shapes from `agent-event-protocols.md`, cross-checked against the backend's
  actual CLI / the dry-run mock, e.g. `packages/cezar/scripts/mock-claude.mjs`).
- `<name>.expected.json` — the **exact** `UiEvent[]` the mapper must produce for
  that transcript.

`<backend>-ui-mapper.test.ts` replays each fixture **exactly as the runner drives
the mapper** (seed turn started before the first line; malformed lines skipped),
round-trips the result through JSON (so a stray `undefined` fails loudly, since
these events get persisted as NDJSON), and asserts `toStrictEqual` against the
`.expected.json`. The same `.expected.json` files feed the parity test in §6.

> Verify fixtures against **upstream wire shapes**, never against your own
> assumptions. PR #443's root cause was a fixture that encoded an *assumed*
> codex shape (`todoList` items that the app-server never emits), which hid a bug
> where a codex plan never rendered at all. When adding a fixture, cite the
> upstream schema/source it was derived from, as #443 did.

## 8. Persistence & transport

- **NDJSON** — one append-only `runs/<id>.ndjson` per run, one JSON object per
  line (`seq`, `ts`, `type`, free extra keys). Never rewrite, reorder or
  re-number; readers skip bad lines. Both v1 and v2 events live here; a mixed
  file is valid. Cezar-owned task events are additive too: for example,
  `provider-auth-required` records only `{ provider, authFailureId, stepId? }`
  when a runtime rejection needs user authorization; it never carries vendor
  error text or credentials.
- **SSE** — the server replays from NDJSON then streams live, deduped by `seq`.
  Event names: `run-event` (v1) and `ui-event` (v2 dotted types). These names are
  a protected contract (see `BACKWARD_COMPATIBILITY.md` §2).

---

## 9. Adding a new runner (the #387 `pi` checklist)

A new backend is a **single class behind the seam** plus its mapper, fixtures and
the parity row — never backend-specific types leaking past
`packages/cezar/src/core/`. PR #387 added `pi` and enumerated every place the
runner union was duplicated; that list is the concrete map, and the union now
derives from one `RUNNER_IDS` tuple in `agent-runner.ts` so most of it is
typecheck-enforced rather than hand-tracked.

To be first-class:

1. **Runner** — `packages/cezar/src/core/pi-runner.ts` implementing `AgentRunner` /
   `AgentSession` (persistent process; `pid`; `sendMessage`/`end`/`interrupt`;
   `result`). Honor `AgentRunSpec` uniformly — use `prependSystemPrompt` if the
   backend has no native system-prompt channel.
2. **Factory** — add the id to `RunnerId` / `RUNNER_IDS` (`agent-runner.ts`) and
   a `case` in `createRunner` (`runner-factory.ts`). Add `UiBackend` in
   `ui-events.ts` **and its mirror** `packages/api-client/src/protocol/ui-events.ts` (the
   type-exactness test guards drift).
3. **Detection** — a `probePi()` in `backend-detect.ts` plus the `BackendCheck`
   name union; degrade gracefully when the CLI is absent (never fail boot). If it
   needs a binary override, add `CEZ_PI_BIN` — and per AGENTS.md's zero-config
   rule, document any new `CEZ_*` var in `.env.example` in the same commit.
4. **Mapper** — `packages/cezar/src/core/<runner>-ui-mapper.ts` emitting the full
   v2 `UiEvent` stream **alongside** v1. Never throw on malformed input; explicit
   immutable state.
5. **v1 alongside v2** — wire `SessionOptions.onUiEvent`; keep the v1
   `AgentEvent` stream flowing unchanged.
6. **Golden fixtures** — `packages/cezar/src/core/__fixtures__/pi/*.ndjson` + `*.expected.json`,
   wire-faithful and citing their upstream source, covering every parity matrix
   capability the backend's wire format is able to produce (§6) — and a
   `pi-ui-mapper.test.ts` replaying them. Where a capability genuinely cannot be
   produced, cite why in the fixture/test the way cursor's `usage`/`thinking`
   exclusions do; never fabricate a frame to fill a row.
7. **Parity** — add `pi` to `BACKENDS` in `ui-parity.test.ts`; every capability
   row must pass, or be excluded via that row's `except` list with a cited
   reason (§6) — never silently skipped. (If the backend has no wire parent
   attribution, document the nesting cell's substitute the way codex's
   review-mode items are handled.)
8. **Plumbing** — the run-store `runner` enum, workflow step schema, the
   `POST /api/runs` / `PUT /api/config` bodies, `resumeCommand()`, the web
   `Runner` type, composer pills/presets, and Settings → Agents. Keep additive
   so old `runs.json` records still parse (the `runner` enum keeps `claude-cli`
   parseable — follow that precedent).
9. **Model selection** — accept `provider/model` where relevant; #387 documents
   the existing inconsistencies (opencode drops a bare model silently) — do not
   reproduce a silent-drop. A backend with no default provider gets no entry in
   `BACKEND_MODEL_MAP`'s default column, so a bare id fails loud.
10. **Credentials** — one entry in `BACKEND_ALLOW_PREFIXES` (`agent-env.ts`):
   `buildChildEnv` is least-privilege per backend, so a multi-provider runner
   must receive credentials for every provider its own model ids can name
   without widening other backends.

## 10. The plan channel (PR #443)

PR #443 (`fix/issue-433-render-plan-todo`, open at the time of writing) hardens
`plan.updated` across all three backends after finding the plan never reached the
cockpit dock — for a different reason on each backend. Its direction, which any
new runner should follow:

- **Claude** — current-session plans use `TaskCreate` / `TaskUpdate` / `TaskList`
  (not only `TodoWrite`); classify all of them as plan tools and fold them into
  a snapshot keyed by the task id the harness reports in each tool's **result**.
- **Codex** — the real plan channel is the turn-level notification
  `turn/plan/updated`, not a `todoList` item (which the app-server never emits);
  map it to `plan.updated` as a full replacement.
- **OpenCode** — `status` is free-form upstream; `cancelled` is a documented
  value. Don't whitelist a few statuses and silently drop the rest — an
  unrecognized status degrades to `pending` so a todo the agent wrote stays on
  screen.
- **General** — `plan.updated` is full-replacement; only a genuinely empty list
  clears the dock (a malformed frame maps to zero events, never a wipe).

The `plan.updated` **event name and payload structure are unchanged**; #443
extends the *handling*, not the wire shape (on `main`, `PlanStatus` is the three
values in §3).

## Compatibility

The agent event protocol is a protected surface: see `BACKWARD_COMPATIBILITY.md`
§7. In short — v1 `AgentEvent` `type` strings and v2 `UiEvent` dotted types are
additive-only; removing/renaming one, or breaking the parity requirement, is a
breaking change requiring the documented deprecation path.
